Sometime in the late fall/winter of 2016, the Defence Logistics Agency moved its website and ceased updating its previous URL, which we had been monitoring. As a result, there was one quarterly update in early 2016 that covered the 1033 program through Dec. 31, 2015 that we initially missed. The data in this folder was gathered from the Wayback Machine, which took [this snapshot on March 20, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084733/http://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/FOIA/EFOIALibrary.aspx), and is date-stamped accordingly. It's unclear on what date this update to the data was originally posted, but it likely would have been in early February
